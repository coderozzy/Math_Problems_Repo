# Task 1 — Is X a Random Variable?

## Answer

**Yes**, $X$ is a random variable. It is a function that assigns a numerical value (grade 2–5) to each elementary event (randomly selecting a student).

## Distribution for 10 students

Grades: $\{5, 4, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 3, 4, 2\}$

Counting: grade 2 → 1, grade 3 → 4, grade 4 → 3, grade 5 → 2

| $x$ | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $P(X=x)$ | $1/10$ | $4/10$ | $3/10$ | $2/10$ |

$$\boxed{P(X=2)=0.1,\; P(X=3)=0.4,\; P(X=4)=0.3,\; P(X=5)=0.2}$$
